             which the Terms have changed, Google will treat your use as acceptance
             of the updated Terms.  If a modification is unacceptable to you, you
             may terminate this agreement by ceasing use of the Maps API(s).<br>

                         appropriate privacy policy in your Maps API Implementation.
                         In particular, if your Maps API Implementation enables you
                         or any party to gain access to information about users of
                         the Maps API(s), including but not limited to personally

               as explicitly permitted in Section 8 (Licenses from Google to You) or
               the Maps APIs Documentation, you must not (nor may you permit anyone
               else to) do any of the following:<br><br>

                    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
                    (a) <u>No Access to Maps API(s) except through the Service.</u> You must
                    not access or use the Maps API(s) or any Content through any
                    technology or means other than those provided in the Service, or
                    through other explicitly authorized means Google may designate.
                    For example, you must not access map tiles or imagery through
                    interfaces or channels (including undocumented Google interfaces)
                    other than the Maps API(s).<br><br>
                    (b) <u>No Hiding of Identity.</u> You must not hide or mask from Google
                    the identity of your Maps API Implementation as it uses the Service, including by
                    failing to follow the identification conventions listed in the
                    Maps APIs Documentation.<br><br>
                    (c) <u>No Reverse Engineering.</u> You must not attempt to reverse
                    engineer or decompile the Services or any component, or attempt to
                    create a substitute or similar service through use of or access to
                    the Services, unless this is expressly permitted or required by
                    applicable law. <br><br>
                    (d) <u>No Modification of Search Results.</u> You must not modify,

                    obscure, or otherwise hinder the functioning of links to Google
                    or third party websites provided in the Content.  For the
                    avoidance of doubt, titles for place results must link to the

                    accessing your Maps API Implementation from a device with
                    appropriately space-constraining user interface options. In these

                        or other device to retrieve or index any portion of the Google

                        </div>
                    (g) <u>No Use of Content without a Google Map.</u> You must not use or
                    display the Content without a corresponding Google map, unless you
                    are explicitly permitted to do so in the Maps APIs Documentation,
                    or through written permission from Google.  In any event, you must not
                    use or display the Content on or in conjunction with a non-Google map.
                    For example, you must not use geocodes obtained through the Service in
                    conjunction with a non-Google map.  As another example, you must not
                    display Street View imagery alongside a non-Google map, but you may
                    display Street View imagery without
                    a corresponding Google map because the Maps APIs Documentation
                    explicitly permits you to do so.<br><br>
                    (h) <u>No Use of Static Maps API(s) outside a Web-Based Application
                    (Except with a Link to Google Maps).</u> You must not use the Static

                        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
                        (i) your platform does not have a web browser; or<br><br>

                        Maps native application (if your platform has one); or (y)

                    (i) <u>No Use Beyond Google's Transaction Limits and Usage Policies.</u>
                    If your Maps API application generates a high volume of transactions,
                    Google reserves the right to set transaction limits, as described
                    in the Documentation
                    <a href="/maps/faq#usagelimits">here</a>.
                    Google also reserves the right to set other
                    usage policies in the Documentation from time to time.  If you
                    want to engage in use outside these transaction limits or usage
                    policies, please contact the Google Maps API for Business sales team for
                    information on licensing options to address your needs.<br><br>
                    (j) <u>Geolocation Privacy.</u><br><br>
                        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
                        (i) Your Maps API Implementation must notify the user in advance of
                        the type(s) of data that you intend to collect from the user or the
                        user's device.  Your Maps API Implementation must not obtain or cache
                        any user's location in any manner except with the user's prior consent.
                        Your Maps API Implementation must let the user revoke the user's consent
                        at any time.<br><br>
                        (ii) If your Maps API Implementation provides Google with geolocation
                        data, that geolocation data must not enable Google to identify an
                        individual user.  For example, if your Maps API Implementation sends
                        Google Your Content, and Your Content includes geolocation data, Your
                        Content must not also include unique device identifiers associated with
                        individual users.<br><br>
                        (iii) If you intend to obtain the user's location and use it with any
                        other data provider's data, you must disclose this fact to the user.<br><br>

                   the Content, except as permitted under Section 9.1.2 (Exceptions).<br><br>

                   for purposes of commercial sales lead generation ("<b>Direct Marketing</b>")

                   printed maps or guide books) that you redistribute for a fee. You must
                   contact the

                   For example, the following are prohibited: (i) creating server-side
                   modification of map tiles; (ii) stitching multiple static map images
                   together to display a map that is larger than permitted in the
                   <a href="/maps/documentation/">Maps
                   APIs Documentation</a>; (iii) creating mailing lists or telemarketing
                   lists based on the Content; or (iv) exporting, writing, or saving
                   the Content to a third party's location-based platform or service.<br><br>
                   (b) <u>No Pre-Fetching, Caching, or Storage of Content.</u> You must not
                   pre-fetch, cache, or store any Content, except that you may store:
                   (i) limited amounts of Content for the purpose of improving the
                   performance of your Maps API Implementation if you do so temporarily
                   (and in no event for more than 30 calendar days),
                   securely, and in a manner that does not permit use of the Content
                   outside of the Service; and (ii) any content identifier or key that
                   the Maps APIs Documentation specifically permits you to store. For
                   example, you must not use the Content to create an independent
                   database of "places" or other local listings information.<br><br>
                   (c) <u>No Mass Downloads or Bulk Feeds of Content.</u> You must not use
                   the Service in a manner that gives you or any other person access
                   to mass downloads or bulk feeds of any Content, including but not
                   limited to numerical latitude or longitude coordinates, imagery,
                   visible map data, or places data (including business listings).
                   For example, you are not permitted to offer a batch geocoding
                   service that uses Content contained in the Maps API(s).

               Permitted to Build with the Maps API(s).</u> Except as explicitly permitted
               in Section 8 (Licenses from Google to You) or the Maps APIs Documentation,
               you must not (nor may you permit anyone else to) do any of the following:<br><br>
                   <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
                   (a) <u>No "Wrapping."</u> You must not create or offer a "wrapper" for the
                   Service, unless you obtain Google's written consent to do so. For example,
                   you are not permitted to: (i) use or provide any part of the Service
                   or Content (such as map imagery, geocoding, directions, places, or
                   terrain data) in an API that you offer to others; or (ii) create a
                   Maps API Implementation that reimplements or duplicates Google Maps/Google Earth.
                   For clarity, you are not "re-implementing or duplicating" Google Maps/Google Earth if your Maps API
                   Implementation provides substantial additional features or content
                   beyond Google Maps/Google Earth, and those additional features or content constitute
                   the primary defining characteristic of your Maps API Implementation.<br><br>
                   (b) <u>No Business, Residential, or Telephone Listings Services.</u> You must
                   not display any of the business listings Content provided by
                   the Maps API(s) in any Maps API Implementation
                   that has the primary purpose of making available business, residential
                   address, or telephone directory listings.<br><br>
                   (c) <u>No Navigation, Autonomous Vehicle Control, or Enterprise

                   systems, or applications for or in connection with any of the following:<br><br>
                       <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
                       (i) real time navigation or route guidance, including but not limited
                       to turn-by-turn route guidance that is synchronized to the position
                       of a user's sensor-enabled device.<br><br>
                       (ii) any systems or functions for automatic or autonomous control
                       of vehicle behavior; or<br><br>
                       (iii) enterprise dispatch, fleet management, business asset tracking

               18.2 If there is any contradiction between the English language

               <b>19.    General Legal Terms.<br>
               <br> </b>
               19.1 <u>Notices</u>.  You agree that Google may provide you
               with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email,
               regular mail, or postings on the Service.<br> <br>
               19.2 <u>No Waiver</u>.
               You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or
               remedy available to it under the Terms (or any applicable law), Google will
               not be deemed to have waived its rights or remedies, and those rights
               and remedies will still be available to Google.  Any waiver of any
               provision of these Terms will be effective
               only if Google expressly states in a signed writing that it is waiving a
               specified Term.<br> <br>
               19.3 <u>Severability</u>.  If any court of law
               that has jurisdiction rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid,
               then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the
               rest of the Terms.  The remaining provisions of the Terms will continue to
               be valid and enforceable.<br> <br>
               19.4    <u>Third Party Beneficiaries</u>.
               You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which
               Google is the parent, and each of the Indemnified Parties, will be third party
               beneficiaries to the Terms and that
               such other companies will be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon,
               any provision of the Terms that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor
               of) them.  Other than this, no other person or company will be a third party
               beneficiary to the Terms.<br> <br>
               19.5    <u>Assignment</u>.  The Terms
               may be assigned by Google and will inure to the benefit of Google, its
               successors, and assigns.<br> <br>
               19.6    <u>Governing Law and Jurisdiction;
               Injunctive Relief</u>.  The Terms, and your relationship with Google under
               the Terms, are governed by the laws of the State of California, USA,
               without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.  You and Google agree to
               submit to the exclusive, personal jurisdiction of the federal or state
               courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, to resolve any
               legal matter arising from or related to
               the Terms.  Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google will be allowed
               to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal
               relief) in any jurisdiction.<br> <br>
               19.7    <u>Complete Agreement</u>.
               These Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Google
               in connection with, and govern your use of, the Service and Content. These
               Terms completely replace and
